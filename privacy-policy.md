# Privacy Policy

## 1. **Introduction**
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect data when you interact with our service designed for compiling pharmacological models using the Heta-compiler. By using our service, you agree to the practices described below.

## 2. **What Data We Collect**
We only process and temporarily store data strictly necessary for providing the service:
- **User Requests:** Input data related to pharmacological models and compilation settings provided in your request.
- **System Metadata:** Statistics about the types and number of requests, system errors, and unauthorized access attempts.

**We do not collect or process any personal data.**

## 3. **How Your Data Is Used**
Your data is used to:
- Compile the pharmacological models using the Heta-compiler.
- Generate output files based on the specified formats.
- Provide you with the compiled results.

The generated results are linked to a unique code (UUID) and are accessible only through this code.

## 4. **Data Storage and Retention**
- By default, data is stored temporarily for **3600 seconds** (1 hour) after processing. After this period, all associated data is automatically deleted.
- You can specify a custom storage period in your request, including **0 seconds** to prevent data from being stored on the server entirely.
- **Permanent Storage:** Only aggregated statistics, such as the number and types of requests, and error logs are stored permanently. These do not include any user-provided data.

## 5. **Data Security**
We use industry-standard measures to ensure the security of your data:
- Access to generated models and compiled data is restricted to the unique code (UUID) provided to you.
- Data is not shared with or accessible to other users or external services.
- Logs of unauthorized access attempts are monitored to enhance system security.

## 6. **Your Rights and Options**
- **Control Data Retention:** You can control how long your data is stored by specifying the retention period in your request.
- **No Storage Option:** You can prevent your data from being stored by setting the retention time to **0 seconds**.

## 7. **Third-Party Access**
No third-party services or individuals have access to the models, generated files, or user-provided data. Only aggregated and anonymized system statistics may be used for internal improvements.

## 8. **Limitations**
- Avoid including sensitive or confidential information in your requests, as the service does not support encryption of model content.
- The UUID should be treated as a secure key for accessing your data during the retention period.

## 9. **Changes to the Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and we recommend reviewing it periodically.
