    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. <strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect data when you interact with our service designed for compiling pharmacological models using the Heta-compiler. By using our service, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

    <h2>2. <strong>What Data We Collect</strong></h2>
    <p>We only process and temporarily store data strictly necessary for providing the service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Requests:</strong> Input data related to pharmacological models and compilation settings provided in your request.</li>
        <li><strong>System Metadata:</strong> Statistics about the types and number of requests, system errors, and unauthorized access attempts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not collect or process any personal data.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. <strong>How Your Data Is Used</strong></h2>
    <p>Your data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Compile the pharmacological models using the Heta-compiler.</li>
        <li>Generate output files based on the specified formats.</li>
        <li>Provide you with the compiled results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The generated results are linked to a unique code (UUID) and are accessible only through this code.</p>

    <h2>4. <strong>Data Storage and Retention</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>By default, data is stored temporarily for <strong>3600 seconds</strong> (1 hour) after processing. After this period, all associated data is automatically deleted.</li>
        <li>You can specify a custom storage period in your request, including <strong>0 seconds</strong> to prevent data from being stored on the server entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent Storage:</strong> Only aggregated statistics, such as the number and types of requests, and error logs are stored permanently. These do not include any user-provided data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. <strong>Data Security</strong></h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures to ensure the security of your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to generated models and compiled data is restricted to the unique code (UUID) provided to you.</li>
        <li>Data is not shared with or accessible to other users or external services.</li>
        <li>Logs of unauthorized access attempts are monitored to enhance system security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. <strong>Your Rights and Options</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Data Retention:</strong> You can control how long your data is stored by specifying the retention period in your request.</li>
        <li><strong>No Storage Option:</strong> You can prevent your data from being stored by setting the retention time to <strong>0 seconds</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. <strong>Third-Party Access</strong></h2>
    <p>No third-party services or individuals have access to the models, generated files, or user-provided data. Only aggregated and anonymized system statistics may be used for internal improvements.</p>

    <h2>8. <strong>Limitations</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The service does not support encryption of model content.</li>
        <li>The UUID should be treated as a secure key for accessing your data during the retention period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. <strong>Changes to the Policy</strong></h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and we recommend reviewing it periodically.</p>
